# Problem Generator
A little program that spits out LaTeX code that creates a worksheet with random problems.

## The Problem
As a tutor, I often need to produce practice problem worksheets for my students. Online solutions do not allow the precise fine tuning I need. For example, if I have a student learning multiplication of fractions and I want them to be able to cancel common factors, I would like to ensure my algorithm will occasionally produce problems that can be solved this way.

## The Solution
This python script is a quick hack that allows me to make these randomly generated worksheets quickly, under the constraints I desire. A proper solution might be a web application that allows me to specify the number of problems, constraints, etc. and compiles the resulting .tex document into a pdf.

## Future Work
I may turn this into a full web app in the future, time permitting.
